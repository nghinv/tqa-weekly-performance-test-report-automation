* Some explanations that help to understand the charts easily:
** **Error bars**: a range to which the next test value will be compared to be considered as an improvement/deterioration if it be out of the range.
*** Error bars of **throughput** value is [-5%; 5%]
*** Error bars of **90% line of response time** value is [-10%; 10%]
** **Worse and Better than BASE range** are error bars made with a test result on BASE package. They should be 2 straight lines.

** In web application performance testing **90% line of response time** is more reliable than **Throughput**
*** **90% line of response time**: a value which 90% of response time values are less than or equal to.
*** **Throughput**: number of test requests done.
